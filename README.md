# Maths_Word_Problem_Solver
A software program which takes mathematical word problems of any complexity or hierarchy but using only particular keywords such as 
Addition,Division,Square,LCM,Percentage etc. as input, then arrange such keywords and numerical values in form of a tree
and solves each subpart of word problem in hierarchy from bottom of the tree to top of the tree,and gives the numerical output. 
E.g.  Input - â€œ What is the division of 120 by multiplication of 5 and LCM of 2,3 and 4 ?"
